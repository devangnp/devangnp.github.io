Given a CSV file with stats, how would you calculate the traffic stats? This is what I am trying to document:

My CSV file looks like:
```
device,intf,input,output
r1,et1,blah,110
r1,et2,102,112
r1,et3,103,113
r2,et1,200,210
r2,et2,202,212
r2,et3,203,213
r3,et1,300,blah
r3,et2,302,312
r3,et3,303,313

```


```python
'''
Reading CSV and cleaning the value
'''
import csv
from collections import defaultdict

total_input = 0
total_output = 0
devices = defaultdict(list)
with open('stats.csv','r') as fh:
    csv_reader = csv.DictReader(fh)
     
    for sw in csv_reader:
        
        if not sw['output'].isnumeric():
            sw['output'] = 0
            
        if not sw['input'].isnumeric():
            sw['input'] = 0
        
        if sw['device'] not in devices:
            devices[sw['device']] = [0,0]
        
        if sw['device'] in devices:
            devices[sw['device']][0] = devices[sw['device']][0] + int(sw['input'])
            devices[sw['device']][1] = devices[sw['device']][1] + int(sw['output'])
            
for device,traffic in devices.items():
    print(device,traffic)
    print(f'Total traffic on {device} is {traffic[0]+traffic[1]}')

```

Output:
```
r1 [205, 335]
Total traffic on r1 is 540
r2 [605, 635]
Total traffic on r2 is 1240
r3 [905, 625]
Total traffic on r3 is 1530
```

Is there a better way?
