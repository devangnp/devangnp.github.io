##### What limits your design or architectural decision?

- Resources are not unlimited!

- Find out the factor which limits or influence the decision and start from there when you are working on new requirement or design or concept.

- I want to buy the best and most expensive house but do I have that much money? In this case money is the limiting factor and I would start looking at the houses which fits in my budget.

- While selecting network device, you may be able to buy the higher capacity router but is your CO space can accommodate that?

- In case of Data Center, I can build higher BW Data Center with many servers/racks but do I have enough power/electricity(MW)?

- Weakest router in your design may restrict how big your OSPF/ISIS database can be!

- Worst link in your network path defines the data transfer speed!

- Best design is not the most technical and expensive design! Best design is the one which solves/meets the business requirements with a given resources.

- In short, identify the factor which is restricting you and start working with or around that to find optimal solution.

- Reduce complexity, increase simplicity:
  - Simple is easy to **understand**.
  - Simple is easy to **explain**.
  - Simple is easy to **build**.
  - Simple is easy to **operate**.
  - Simple is easy to **recover**.
  - Simple is easy to **handover**.
