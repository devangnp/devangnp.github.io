Recently I worked on the scenario where the specific protocol on multiple routers were going down. In such scenario usual troubleshooting would focus on:
- Is CPU utilization high on control plane?
- Is there some kind of DDOS to congest specific host bound queue?
- Is there a unknown TLV or update specific protocol receiving and advertising it to all neighbor before its going down?

One more scenario that I learn during this troubleshooting was related to flowspec was detecting the attack and generating the flowspec filter related to ```224.0.0.2``` address which was causing the protocol to flap, after some time monitoring device will no longer consider it as a attacking traffic and it will remove the programing flowspec filter and protocol adjacency would come back up. 

Learning based on this debugging is to be more careful what you generate and send as flowspec filter and safeguard the router as well to avoid programing such route. 

I have seen the history of issues where flowspec filters are not cleared or updated which caused unwanted traffic filtering or filter becomes so big that the forwarding engine would spend lot of instruction just processing that filter and the line rate performance would be degraded. 

In short, BGP flowspec is good tool but while using it keep updating and maintaining it properly to avoid such protocol downtime or flap or unwanted traffic black-hole or reduction in forwarding capabilities. 

In remaining post, I will go over the configuration, verification and safeguarding the flowspec from router perspective.

In my lab testing I am using this great tool [ExaBGP](https://github.com/Exa-Networks/exabgp){:target="_blank"} to generate the flowspec update. 

I have loaded the ExaBGP tool on my lab VM which is connected to the router.

ExaBGP config to establish and generate the flowspec routes:
```
root@ubuntu:~/exabgp# cat conf3.ini 
process announce-routes {
    run /usr/bin/python3 /root/exabgp/bgproutes.py;
    encoder json;
}

neighbor 1.1.102.2 {
    local-address 1.1.102.1;
    local-as 200;
    peer-as 100;
    flow {
      route {
         match {
            destination 224.0.0.2/32;
         }
         then {
            discard;
         }
      }
      route {
         match {
            source 172.16.1.1/32;
         }
         then {
            discard;
         }
      }
      route {
         match {
            destination 172.16.2.1/32;
         }
         then {
            discard;
         }
      }   
      route {
         match {
            source 172.16.3.1/32;
            destination 172.16.4.1/32;
            protocol tcp;
         }
         then {
            discard;
         }
      }

   }
}
```
Run the exabgp with config file:
```

```
Router configuration to establish the BGP with exabgp:
```
lab@r1-re0# show protocols bgp group server                       
neighbor 1.1.102.1 {
    family inet {
        unicast;
        flow {
            no-validate my_flowspec_policy;
        }
    }
    peer-as 200;
}
```
In configuration we see the policy ```my_flowspec_policy``` and we will talk about it later. Letâ€™s first verify the BGP neighbor state and route status on the router. 

BGP is up and running. Note the special table ```inetflow.0``` is created and populated with routes, we are receiving total of 4 routes, out of 4 we have 3 active routes:
```
lab@r1-re0# run show bgp summary 
...
1.1.102.1               200         68         64       0      23        2:51 Establ
  inet.0: 3/3/3/0
  inetflow.0: 3/4/3/0

lab@r1-re0# run show bgp neighbor 1.1.102.1 | match NLRI            
  NLRI inet-flow: No-validate [ everything ] 
  NLRI for restart configured on peer: inet-unicast inet-flow

  NLRI for this session: inet-unicast inet-flow
```

Routes we received from ExaBGP server:
```

There is one hidden route as well and that is due to the policy that we have created. 
```
lab@r1-re0# run show route table inetflow.0 extensive hidden

```				
Here is the policy configuration which is blocking the ```172.16.2.1``` prefix.
```
lab@r1-re0# show policy-options policy-statement my_flowspec_policy 
term 1 {
    from {
        route-filter 172.16.2.1/32 exact;
    }
    then reject;
}
term 2 {
    then accept;
}				
```

With all above, our flowspec filter is programming looks like this:
```
lab@r1-re0# run show firewall filter __flowspec_default_inet__ 

Filter: __flowspec_default_inet__                              
Counters:
Name                                                Bytes              Packets
*,172.16.1.1                                            0                    0
172.16.4.1,172.16.3.1,proto=6                           0                    0
224.0.0.2,*                                          2590                   37


lab@r1-re0# run show firewall filter __flowspec_default_inet__    

Filter: __flowspec_default_inet__                              
Counters:
Name                                                Bytes              Packets
*,172.16.1.1                                            0                    0
172.16.4.1,172.16.3.1,proto=6                           0                    0
224.0.0.2,*                                          2660                   38				
```
In above output, you can see we have programmed the three combination to drop various kind of traffic and ```172.16.2.1``` is not program as filter term due to the policy which is blocking. 

The interesting observation is about the ```224.0.0.2,*``` entry, I can see the counter is incrementing. ```224.0.0.2``` is reserved address for all router multicast address and used by many protocol to send the keep alive so if I advertise the flowspec route to block that address, some of the control protocol traffic will be drop and adjacency will time out so we need to be very careful.

Flow detective device can work mechanically and push such update, however we can take an extra precaution to safeguard and block such updates on router itself and the policy we used ```my_flowspec_policy``` will come to rescue. 

In the lab we will insert one more term to reject the ```224.0.0.2``` in flowspec update:
```
lab@r1-re0# show policy-options policy-statement my_flowspec_policy 
term 1 {
    from {
        route-filter 172.16.2.1/32 exact;
    }
    then reject;
}
term 2 {   <<<<<
    from {
        route-filter 224.0.0.2/32 exact;
    }
    then reject;
}
term 3 {
    then accept;
}
```
After modifying the policy, we can see that we are not installing the ```224.0.0.2``` flowspec route in ```inetflow.0``` table as well as we are not programing the term in flowspec filter. 
```
